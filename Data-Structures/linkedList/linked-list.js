// Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

// Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).
